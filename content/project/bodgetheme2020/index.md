### {{< icon name="fa-bug" >}} Badge.team website project

The Badge.team decided it was about time to build a new website to properly display our endeavors, challenges and share the fun in designing badges for hacker conferences.

This bodgetheme (inside joke) project is about design and build of this website. Our blogs might contain updates on progress, but might just show a layout/functionality test page as well.
