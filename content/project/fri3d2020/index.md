{{< alert-attention "PLEASE NOTE" >}}This project is developed by a different team than badge.team and we do NOT claim it's ours. This project has been added during this development stage for reference only. Soon we'll decide on if we remove it immediately or contact the rightful project owners if they would like it to stay.{{< /alert-attention >}}

Welcome to the project page of the Fri3D 2020 Badge project. This project page is still a work in progress and we expect to fill it with content soon.
