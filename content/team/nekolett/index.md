# Nikolett :: Ankhaneko ::

I am a freelancer Graphic Designer, Product Designer-in-training & Illustrator, who is always eager to learn something new, and work towards to understand different aspects, and love to explore. Designer of tilde.industries.

At the present, I am developing my skills in Digital Graphic softwares, Product and Package Design, 3D modeling softwares in both organic sculpting and engineering categories, and I keep on working with traditional art techniques, such as watercolour & other types of painting.

My main inspiration comes by observing our environment, thus my core way of illustrating will always look organic, naturalistic.I love to combine Old and New: most of my digital paintings and drawings have a pencil lineart as their skeleton. I am fond of Art History, and Ancient Times.
