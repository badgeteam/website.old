I am a freelancer graphic designer, product designer-in-training & illustrator, who is always eager to learn something new, works towards understanding different aspects, and loves to explore. Designer of tilde.industries.

At the present, I am developing my skills in digital graphic software, product and package design, 3D modeling software for both organic sculpting and engineering. I also continue to work with traditional art techniques, such as watercolour & other types of painting.

My main inspiration comes from observing our environment, thus my core way of illustrating will always look organic and naturalistic. I love to combine old and new; most of my digital paintings and drawings have pencil line art as their skeletons. I am fond of art history and ancient times.
