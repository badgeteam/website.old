We wish our friends in China the best as we wait for the coronavirus situation to improve. We expect industry to start in the second half of February, but everyone will have a lot of catching up to do. The last prototype will likely arrive in March, and we can't wait. :smile:

In the mean time, we need a cool new name for this blinky device! Any suggestions?

The winning answer gets one for free! :sunglasses:
