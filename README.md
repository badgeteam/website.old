# Future website

This repository contains the source of what will become the main website for the BADGE.TEAM project.

It is currently being published on [bodge.team](https://bodge.team) to serve as a playground for our website team to develop this site.

## Local development

To build this website you need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

After doing that you can run the following commands to start a local development webserver:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/badgeteam/website.git
cd website
hugo server
```

Once the server is running you can visit http://localhost:1313 to view your local copy of the site.
